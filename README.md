# bloodbridge
App Name: BloodBridge
Purpose: BloodBridge is a life-saving mobile application designed to connect blood recipients with matching donors. Recipients can submit requests with proof, view donor availability, and directly contact donors once their request is accepted. Donors, on the other hand, can browse incoming requests, choose which to accept, and coordinate with recipients. The app ensures secure communication through built-in chat, maintains request history for both parties, and uses role-based authentication for donor/recipient accounts. Sign-up includes email verification to activate accounts, ensuring trust and authenticity in the network.
Platform: Flutter
